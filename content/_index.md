        In the <u>D</u>esign <u>I</u>nnovation & <u>G</u>enerative <u>I</u>n<u>t</u>elligence (DIGIT) Lab, we study *how AI can design better materials, structures, and machines*. Specifically, we develop advanced AI and machine learning methods for engineering design, targeting some of today's most challenging problems in **design ideation** (how can AI help us generate innovative ideas?), **design automation** (how can AI automate the design process?), and **design for X** (how can AI advance design for manufacturing, sustainability, and beyond?).
