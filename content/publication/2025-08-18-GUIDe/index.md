abstract: Inverse design problems are pervasive in engineering, particularly when dealing with nonlinear system responses, such as in mechanical behavior or spectral analysis. The inherent intractability, non-existence or non-uniqueness of their solutions, and the need for swift exploration of the solution space necessitate the adoption of machine learning and data-driven approaches, such as deep generative models. Here, we show that both deep generative model-based and optimization-based methods can yield unreliable solutions or incomplete coverage of the solution space. To address this, we propose the Generative and Uncertainty-informed Inverse Design (GUIDe) framework, leveraging probabilistic machine learning, statistical inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate designs with targeted nonlinear behaviors. "response → design", we employ a "design → response" strategy: a forward model that predicts each design's nonlinear functional response allows GUIDe to evaluate the confidence that a design will meet the target, conditioned on a target response with a user-specified tolerance level. Then, solutions are generated by sampling the solution space based on the confidence. We validate the method by designing the interface properties for nacre-inspired composites to achieve target stress-strain responses. Results show that GUIDe enables the discovery of diverse feasible solutions, including those outside the training data range, even for out-of-distribution targets.
