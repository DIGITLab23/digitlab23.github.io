Research in the DIGIT Lab aims to answer this overarching question: *How can AI design better materials, structures, and machines?* We look beyond model performance and efficiency to focus on four key challenges: 

1. **Complexity:** How can AI enable a level of design complexity that is fundamentally inaccessible to existing design methodologies?
2. **Creativity:** How can AI enable or accelerate the discovery of "out-of-the-box" design solutions?
3. **Trustworthiness:** How can we develop AI-driven design methodologies that end-users can trust?
4. **Insights:** How can AI generate new knowledge that expands human understanding and guides design? 

Guided by these fundamental questions, we develop computational methodologies for design ideation, generative design, and design for X ("X" can represent manufacturing, sustainability, reliability, and beyond) across diverse engineering domains.

Engineering design problems span a wide range of domain-specific contexts--such as aerospace (e.g., designing aerodynamic shapes and structures), materials science (e.g., designing new materials and metamaterials), and robotics (e.g., designing soft actuators). Our research **abstracts these domain-specific problems and reformulates them as mathematical problems**, developing AI-driven design methodologies to solve them while incorporating domain knowledge when needed.

Our methodologies usually follow a **"generative"** paradigm, where AI learns to generate design solutions by modeling their underlying distributions and capturing uncertainties. Our goal is to leverage AI and ML to improve **efficiency**, stimulate **creativity**, and uncover **new knowledge and insights** in design processes, while ensuring the **generalizability** and **trustworthiness** of these methods.
