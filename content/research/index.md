In the Design Innovation & Generative InTelligence (DIGIT) Lab, we develop advanced **AI and machine learning (ML)** methods for engineering design, targeting some of todayâ€™s most challenging problems in design ideation, design automation, and design for manufacturing.

* **Design ideation:** Human creativity is constrained by individual knowledge and experience, with outcomes often highly uncertain. We explore how AI can enhance the generation of creative design ideas, fostering human-AI co-creativity and accelerating design innovation.
* **Design automation:** We develop AI and ML methods to enhance the generation of detailed design solutions, addressing the challenges of vast design spaces, costly design evaluations (e.g., simulations and experiments), and inherent uncertainties.
* **Design for manufacturing:** We leverage AI and ML to design better manufacturing processes, enable new manufacturing techniques, and optimize design solutions by accounting for manufacturing imperfections.

Our methodologies usually follow a **"generative"** paradigm, where AI learns to generate design solutions by modeling their underlying distributions and capturing uncertainties. Our goal is to leverage AI and ML to improve **efficiency**, stimulate **creativity**, and uncover **new knowledge and insights** in design processes, while ensuring the **generalizability** and **trustworthiness** of these methods.
