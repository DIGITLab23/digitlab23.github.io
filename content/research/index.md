Research in the DIGIT Lab aims to answer this overarching question: *How can AI design better materials, structures, and machines?* We look beyond model performance and efficiency to focus on four key challenges: 

1. **Complexity:** How can AI enable a level of design complexity that is fundamentally inaccessible to existing design methodologies?
2. **Creativity:** How can AI enable or accelerate the discovery of "out-of-the-box" design solutions?
3. **Trustworthiness:** How can we develop AI-driven design methodologies that end-users can trust?
4. **Insights:** How can AI generate new knowledge that expands human understanding and guides design? 

Guided by these fundamental questions, we develop computational methodologies for design ideation, generative design, and design for X ("X" can represent manufacturing, sustainability, reliability, and beyond) across diverse engineering domains.
