Kanaad is a MS student majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Kanaad received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a specialization in AI&ML from the SRM Institute of Science & Technology in 2025. Currently, he is developing a generative AI framework designed to quantify and predict complex structural variations in advanced manufacturing. His research focuses on building robust data pipelines that extract intrinsic geometric features to better understand how physical products deviate from their digital designs. By leveraging multi-stage machine learning strategies—including pretraining on synthetic models and fine-tuning with real-world data—he is working to create more reliable, high-fidelity models that can adapt to diverse manufacturing processes even when physical data is scarce. The goal is to bridge the gap between nominal design and real-world fabrication through advanced computational geometry and generative modeling under the supervision of Dr. Chen. In his leisure time, Kanaad likes playing sports such as Tennis, Cricket, and enjoys travelling (especially off-beat) and a cook-off.
