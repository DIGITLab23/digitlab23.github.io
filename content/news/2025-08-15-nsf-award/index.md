Our project "Design-by-Learning and Learning-from-Design: White-Box Data-Driven Design of 2D Material-Based Biosensors and Its Impact on Designers" has been awarded funding by NSF. This project investigates how artificial intelligence can overcome current challenges in designing biosensors based on two-dimensional materials, moving beyond laborious trial-and-error methods, while simultaneously enabling human experts to acquire new knowledge in this domain.
