Our lab is thrilled to announce the successful completion of the [TAMUQ Summer Research Internship Program](https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/students/aggiesabroad/tsre-qatar-texas) and the [Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program](https://engineering.tamu.edu/admissions-and-aid/undergraduate-summer-research-grants/index.html) for 2024. This year, we had the pleasure of hosting two outstanding undergraduate students, [Ms. Wisam Gadam](https://digitlab23.github.io/team/Wisam-Gadam) and [Mr. Eddie Guerrero](https://digitlab23.github.io/team/Eddie-Guerrero), who have significantly contributed to our research endeavors. Wisam has been working on Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and their application to generative inverse design, while Eddie focused on predicting material properties of metamaterials for manufacturing uncertainty quantification applications.

We look forward to seeing their continued success and impact in their respective fields. Congratulations to Wisam and Eddie for their outstanding work this summer!
